# Duchess
###### A playing card game: programmed in Python3.3.5rc1, inspired by YuGiOh

After only a few months of playing YuGiOh, as interesting and as fun as the game is, I realised rather quickly that money was a major obstacle when playing. There's a good amount of luck and ingenuity that also goes into the game but, when using said ingenuity to make a deck that suits you, you need to have the money to afford all the cards that you want. Because of the game's popularity, some YuGiOh cards can cost more than the price of brand new console games and retain that value over a long period of time, making it hard for those that don't earn money to get into the game.

Duchess aims to fix that. While it'd be difficult to match the expansiveness and intricacy of YuGiOh, the aim of Duchess is to be inclusive through affordability, fairness and fun. It's rare for a pack of 52 playing cards to even exceed Â£10, making all physical resources needed for the game already affordable. Multiple decks could even be used and the game still wouldn't be considered expensive. Everyone playing should start only with the element of luck which, as the game progresses, develops into the element of skill. This stops players from having the constant advantage of an over-powering deck. Finally, having YuGiOh as an inspiration means that Duchess aims to be a game where a vast number of skillful events can happen, increasing the level of fun that those involved can have.

Any help or suggestions on this project would be appreciated. I know I'm looking forward to seeng how it will finally turn out.
